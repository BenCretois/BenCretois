### Hi there üëã

I am a **researcher** at the [Norwegian Institute for Nature Research](https://www.nina.no/english/home) working with artificial intelligence, statistics and bioacoustics. Most of my work is hosted on our institutional GitHub [NINAnor](https://github.com/NINAnor) and **is open source**.

My work focus on **developing** and **using** deep learning algorithms for biodiversity conservation. I am particularly interested in **using AI in bioacoustic** (e.g. detection and classification of audio events) but also using **AI for image processing** (e.g. detection and classification of animals). I code mostly in Python but I do love R for data analysis and for making fancy plots (`ggplot2` is the best).

Some examples of my work include:

- An [application to run a snowmobile detector on an audiodataset](https://github.com/NINAnor/snowmobile_analyzer)
- An [end to end pipeline for training and using VAD models in soundscape analysis](https://github.com/NINAnor/ecoVAD)
- A [pipeline for training a prototypical network for few shot bioacoustic event detections](https://github.com/NINAnor/rare_species_detections)
- A [R Shiny application for visualizing the potential release of CO2 when constructing](https://carbonviewer.nina.no/)

I am also very found of **grappling sports** and in particular brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ) and when not at work I am usually training ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è or taking my dog for long walks.

I am always open for new collaborations so don‚Äôt hesitate to send me a [mail](benjamin.cretois@nina.no).
