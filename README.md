### Hi there üëã

I am a **researcher / data scientist** at the [Norwegian Institute for Nature Research](https://www.nina.no/english/home) working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, statistics, bioacoustics and more generally biodiversity conservation. Most of my work is hosted on our institutional GitHub [NINAnor](https://github.com/NINAnor).

My work focus on **developing** and **using** deep learning algorithms for biodiversity conservation. I am particularly interested in **using AI in bioacoustic**. I am also developing guidelines for using supercomputers (UNINETT Sigma2 in particular) as well as the associated technologies (e.g. containers, softwares for parallelizing AI workflows etc.).

Some examples of my work include:

- A [mdbook on the use of supercomputers](https://ninanor.github.io/91126800_ML_and_associated_tech/)
- An [end to end pipeline for training and using VAD models in soundscape analysis](https://github.com/NINAnor/ecoVAD).

I am also very found of **grappling sports** and in particular wrestling and brazilian jiu jitsu and when not at work I am usually on the mat trying some fancy takedowns ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I am always open for new collaborations so don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me by mail, twitter or any other medium.
